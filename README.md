# Repository

/data

Place where the data is going to be analyzed  <br> 

/models <br> 

Place where the models are implement. There are three different models in the folder.  <br> 

model_1 = Uses a Gaussian naive bayes model to make classifications <br> 
model_2 = Uses a Random forest model to make classifications <br> 
model_3 = Uses a Support Vector Machine model to make classifications  <br> 

/performance <br> 

Shows the performance of each model, and how they developed <br> 

/preprocessing <br>

Place dedicated to transform data into a more usable form, in order to improve our models performance

/saved_models <br> 

Place where the pickle models are going to be saved in orders to use them later for later predictions, or furthermore <br>
